When reporting a bug, please provide the following information to speed up triage:

* NUnit and NUnit3TestAdapter versions
* Visual Studio edition and full version number (see Help About)
* A short repro, preferably attached or pointing to a git repo or gist
* What .net platform and version is being targeted
* If TFS/VSTS issue, what version, hosted or on-premises, and what build task you see this in
